# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-14)

**Core value:** Every moment Claude makes the user wait becomes an opportunity for dhikr — a Quranic ayah displayed beautifully in the terminal.

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Phase 1]: Hook output mechanism is UNRESOLVED — must empirically test `/dev/tty`, `systemMessage`, and `process.stderr` in a live Claude Code session before writing rendering code. This is the single blocking question for the entire display pipeline.
- [Phase 1]: Use CommonJS (`require()`), not ESM — chalk@4.1.2 (last CJS version), custom Unicode box renderer (avoid boxen ESM issue), `string-width@4` if needed.
- [All phases]: Use `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` in hooks.json and `__dirname` in Node scripts — never hardcoded paths, never `process.cwd()`.
- [Phase 01-foundation-and-hook-scaffold]: Used ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT} in hook command even though empty during SessionStart (GitHub #27145); script resolves own root via three-strategy fallback
- [Phase 01-foundation-and-hook-scaffold]: fallback.json: Hilali-Khan translations, multi-theme tagging allowed, time slots by thematic fit (fajr/isha=reflective, duha/asr=active)
- [Phase 01-foundation-and-hook-scaffold]: systemMessage JSON on stdout confirmed as the sole working output channel for Claude Code hooks; stderr and /dev/tty tested via diagnostic script
- [Phase 01-foundation-and-hook-scaffold]: Plugin root Strategy 3 (__dirname relative) is effective fallback since CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT is empty during SessionStart (GitHub #27145)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 1]: Hook output mechanism ambiguity (CRITICAL) — three research sources conflict on whether `/dev/tty`, `systemMessage`, or `process.stderr` is the correct display channel. Must be resolved before Phase 2 rendering work begins.
